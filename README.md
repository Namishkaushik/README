# KEYWORDS:
# Computation:
Computation is driven by the CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These components form the backbone of data processing and number crunching in both personal and enterprise computing environments.
# Hardware:
Hardware includes the physical components that make up a computer system. From the memory (RAM) and storage devices to semiconductors that drive the computational logic, hardware plays a vital role in computing.
# Storage
In computer science, storage is the process of capturing and preserving digital information on storage media. Storage can be used in many places, including offices, data centers, remote locations, and mobile devices.
# Fullstack Development
A Fullstack developer is proficient in both frontend and backend technologies. This combined skill set allows developers to create fully integrated web applications.
